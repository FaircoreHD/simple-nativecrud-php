Simple CRUD operation using Native PHP

## Usage
After creating your localhost setting and duplicating / clone this repo, so you can access this repo like the usual step by step way to deal with php native project (I ASUME THAT YOU ALREADY UNDERSTAND HOW TO DO ALL OF THAT), do the following :
1. Go to `config.php` to change the environtment for connecting to database (like `dbusername`, `dbpassword`, `dbhost`)
2. Just leave setting for `dbname` to it's default value
3. Create database name `mahasiswa`, and then import using the existing `import.sql` file
4. You are ready to go, just go to your localhost url for this project
